Instructions for getting modded minecraft up and running on clients and connecting to the server.

1. Buy minecraft java edition from the [offical minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft).
2. Get [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/). This is the program that will manage minecraft and its mods.
3. Unzip the MultiMC file and run the MultiMC.exe.
    > Note: you may get a warning from windows saying the developer is unknown. This is fine. Windows is just being overly causous about running code that is not from a well known
    > company. If you have any concerns about running MultiMC, you can inspect the source code yourself [here](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/).
4. Right click and press `Create instance`.
5. Download the modpack I have prepared [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOYQ7dOCvzth2o5nGEifUxKkbj2FhPkl/view?usp=sharing).
    > Note: This modpack is originally from FTB academy. I decided to fork it so we have the abilitly to add and remove mods in the future.
5. In MultiMC, select `Import from zip` and navigate to the zip file you just downloaded.
4. Go to `Setting->Java` and increase your maximum memory allocation. I have mine set to `5120 MB`.
6. Double click on the newly added icon to run the game.
7. Reach out to Sean to get the ip address of the server and to have him add you to the server whitelist.
